# CONTEXT.md — Agent Shared Memory
# Update this every time you finish a task or switch agents

## Project: SpeakPrep — Real-time Voice AI Mock Interview Coach
## Author: Abhiyan Sainju
## Started: April 2026
## Contributors: Abhiyan Sainju only — no AI tools (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, etc.) appear as git contributors
## Current Phase: 0 — Environment Setup (COMPLETE)
## Current Task: Phase 0 tagged — ready for Phase 1

## GIT CONTRIBUTOR RULE — Critical
**Only Abhiyan Sainju appears as a contributor on GitHub. Always.**
- Never add `Co-Authored-By:` trailers to any commit
- Never use `--author` flags with AI tool names
- Commits are made by the user's git identity only

## AGENT SETUP — Run This First Every Session
**Always activate the Python venv before running any backend commands:**
```bash
source backend/.venv/bin/activate
```
- Python 3.12 venv lives at `backend/.venv/` (gitignored)
- Dev tools (ruff, mypy, pytest, pre-commit) are installed inside it
- Without activation: wrong Python version, missing packages, pre-commit may fail

## AGENT HANDOFF PROTOCOL — Do This Before Switching Agents
1. **Commit current state**
   ```bash
   git add -p
   git commit -m "wip: [what you were doing] — switching agents"
   ```
2. **Update CONTEXT.md** — Current Task, What's Working, What's In Progress, What's Blocked
   ```bash
   git add CONTEXT.md
   git commit -m "docs: update CONTEXT.md before agent switch"
   ```
3. **Push**
   ```bash
   git push origin [current-branch]
   ```

## GIT DISCIPLINE — Agents Must Follow This
**Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`. Always stage granularly.**

### Commit message format
```
type(scope): short description (max 72 chars)
```
Types: `feat` `fix` `test` `docs` `refactor` `perf` `chore` `revert` `wip`
Scopes: `audio` `vad` `asr` `llm` `tts` `ws` `api` `auth` `db` `cache` `pipeline` `scoring` `resume` `questions` `dashboard` `ci` `infra`

### Rules
- One logical unit per commit (one function, one test, one config change)
- `wip:` commits only on feature branches — never merge to develop
- Always branch from `develop`, never from `main`
- Branch naming: `feature/vad-recorder`, `fix/auth-token-expiry`, `chore/update-deps`
- Delete feature branches after merge
- Tag each phase completion: `git tag -a v0.X.0-phaseN -m "Phase N complete: ..."`

### Branch protection
- `main` — requires PR + CI pass + 1 review
- `develop` — requires CI pass
